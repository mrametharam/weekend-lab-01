# weekend-lab-01
The purpose of this project is to research how to best build a web API to be performant and resilient.


## Objectives

> Build a web API using .Net Core 8 and minimal API that can handle hundres of simultaneous requests.
> Add a database project for building out the SQL environment. This should make it easy for anyone else to play around with this project.
> Implement caching using Masstransit and Rabbit MQ.
> Build a consumer that can quickly go through the queue and save the data to a SQL table.
> Properly implement and document different design patterns.


## Tools

This project was inspired by "Gemini", Google's AI.  
The data used here was generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).


## Setting up your environment

> Install Podman (free) instead of Docker (not free).
> Setup a containerized instance of MS SQL.
> Setup a containerized instance of RabbitMQ.
